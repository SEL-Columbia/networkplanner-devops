Overview
========

Repository for automated deployment/configuration of computing nodes associated with networkplanner.

To deploy to a network planner node use:

    fab -H host provision:system_type=<system>,branch=<np_branch>
    fab -H host deploy:system_type=<system>,branch=<np_branch>

Where <system> is one of:
* `ss` - Single Server Mode
* `cs` - Cluster Server that "manages" clusters
* `cp` - A cluster processor computing node


Main Components
===============

* `fabfile.py` - fabfile which orchestrates deployment
* `chef-repo` - the chef configuration for setting up nodes
* `<server-type>.json` - files defining chef components of each server type

Caveat Emptor
=============

THIS IS INCOMPLETE!!!

fab provision task has not been defined

No systems other than single-server have been tested

Testing has only been done on vagrant vm's (not amazon or other linux instances)
